Algorithms referenced in the McArdle, et al., Bioprotocols paper

**FIJI with MISTICA**
The zip file is too large to upload to Github and can be found on Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fFgiVjAydcCcGVV_ZjZ6S_mQBZWVMEw4/view?usp=share_link
This is an old version of FIJI with MISTICA image alignment pre-installed. There are problems updating the plugin to the newest Fiji. Hopefully they will be fixed by the time the Bioprotocols paper is published. Temporary Solution: Download the zipped FIJI version. DO NOT UPDATE. Open your tif or lif images and run MSTHyperStackReg2 in plugins.

**SpiderPlots**
There are two versions of this script:
1) The compiled executable application can be run without a Matlab license. Download and install the installer (Windows Only). When you run the program, a file dialog will pop up, and then it will generate the graphs.

2) The Matlab .m file. If you have a Matlab license, this allows you to adjust the graph to your liking.
